# Configuration System - Digital Portfolio
#### In progress

## Description
The idea of this project is to create a customizable portfolio for designers with the ability to fully manage it without writing a single line of code. Every object inside the portfolio can be modified through this config system.

The project is still a work in progress, take a look at what I managed to accomplish to this day.
